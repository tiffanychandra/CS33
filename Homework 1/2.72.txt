Problem 2.72

A. The conditional test in the code will always succeed because the sizeof operator will return a value of type size_t, which is an unsigned type. So, when we compute maxbytes-sizeof(val) and obtain the size_t type, it will always be >= 0. 

B. We can rewrite the conditional test to make it work as follows: 
void copy_int(int val, void *buf, int maxbytes) {
	if (maxbytes >= (int) sizeof(val))
		memcpy(buf, (void *) &val, sizeof(val));

}
