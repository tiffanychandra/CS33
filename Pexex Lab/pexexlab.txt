The purpose of this lab was to explore program execution using gdb and particularly noting when the operation of multiplication has to deal with signed overflow. I was mainly walking through the arith_driver function when executing the test.  

First I run the following command to debug using gdb and enter the data file:
$gdb ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-26.1

To print each instruction as we step through the machine code:
(gdb) set disassemble-next-line on

Set a breakpoint whenever Ftimes function is called:
(gdb) break Ftimes

The following cammand is run to perform the desired operation (multiplication)
(gdb) r -batch -eval '(print (* 1250284240 -1844255039))'

I encountered an error with the gdb "missing separate debuginfos", which was resolved by using #debuginfo-install and the trailing statements stated in the error.

Whenever the function would stop at Ftimes and after analyzing the change in the last step, the following command can execute the next instruction that calls Ftimes
(gdb) si

To check the values in registers to gather for the trace file:
(gdb) info registers

And to find the value of a specific register:
(gdb) info registers $register 

The trace file ends when the arith_driver function ends.
