 submit a file leothread.c that is like hello.c (Figure 12.13), except that it creates and reaps L(N) - 1 joinable threads, where N is a positive command-line argument and L(N) is the Nth Leonardo number. These threads should be created as a Fibonacci tree of order N rooted in the main thread, where thread corresponding to a node creates and reaps the threads corresponding to the node's children. The Fibonacci trees of order 0 and 1 have just a root node, and a Fibonacci tree of order N > 1 has left and right Fibonacci subtrees of order N-1 and N-2, respectively.
 
 Nodes in the tree of threads should be labeled 0 through L(N)-1 in preorder: that is, each thread should have a label that is a unique integer in the range 0 .. L(N)-1, where the main thread's label is 0 and each non-leaf thread labeled T and with L(k) - 1 descendants (for some k) has two children labeled T + 1 and T + 1 + L(k - 1). Each leaf thread should simply print "[T]\n" where T is the threadâ€™s label; each non-leaf thread with label T should first print "(T\n", then create and reap its two children, and finally print "T)\n" just before exiting. The main thread counts as a thread and so should print too. The main thread is a leaf if and only if N=1.
